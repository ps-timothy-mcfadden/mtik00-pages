One of the great things about using a static site generator is the ease at which you can use a *version control system* to maintain it.  Publishing your content could be as simple as committing your changes.  In this blog post, I'll be covering one way to do that when you are using your own web server.

For this example, I'm going to assume you have full command-line access to your web server (e.g. [Amazon's Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) service).  This is not the post for you if that's not the case!

Configuring Hugo
================
-  publish dir
-  really not much else

Configuring the web server
==========================
-  ssh keys
-  sparse repo
-  synce
-  publish

Configuring local git repo
==========================
-  probably nothing here
