I've been writing software since I figured out how to hack [Lemonade Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand) back in the late 1970's (ok, *writing* is a bit of a stretch).  I absolutely **adored** my [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).  Man, those power bricks just didn't last!

My interest in computers never waned.  I moved on from my C64, to my parents [C128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) (dual disk drives!  woot!), to a 286, 386, 486, Pentium, and so on.  After a short stint in the [military](http://www.goarmy.com/), I moved to Colorado Springs to go to school.

I graduated from [UCCS](http://www.uccs.edu/) in the spring of 1999 with a Bachelors of Electrical Engineering.  I really thought I wanted to be an analog designer.  That dream was short lived!  I soon realized that what truly made me happy was programming.  With that knowledge in hand, I went back to school.

I graduated from [CTU](http://www.coloradotech.edu/) in the spring of 2005 with a Masters of Science in Software Engineering.  I finally had the piece of paper that *proved* I could write code.  I left my semiconductor job for a much-more-software-focused job in electrical test equipment (logic analyzers, to be exact).  That worked out great, until they laid me off (no worries, I enjoyed the 3 months severance).  

Luckily, I was hired right away.  I continue to work in the storage industry, but I'm happy to say I'm 100% software focused!  I've been writing code to facilitate test automation since 2007 (mainly [Python](https://www.python.org/)).  I really enjoy the challenge and I love the instant feedback I get since my customers sit right next to me.

About The Name
==============

The name `mtik`, pronouced "*em tick*", was my very first [EverQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest) character (a Gnome [Necromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest#Casters)).  I had played quite a bit of [Ultima Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online) prior to the release of EverQuest, but I can't remember any of my character names.  I used `mtik` as a character name for all of the [MMORPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) that followed.  It stuck!  I became quite fond of it.  I added the `00` to the end due to a name-collision when I signed up for something or another.
